**Introduction:**

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** has emerged as a powerful paradigm in Artificial Intelligence, enabling agents to learn optimal behavior through interaction with their environment. In this project, we present an advanced implementation of RL techniques to solve the **Cartpole problem**, a classic benchmark in the field of RL. The Cartpole problem challenges agents to balance a pole affixed to a cart by applying appropriate control actions, making it an ideal testbed for evaluating RL algorithms.

**Problem Statement:**

The Cartpole problem involves balancing a pole vertically on a moving cart, with the objective of preventing the pole from falling over. The environment provides feedback in the form of rewards, where the agent receives a positive reward for each time step the pole remains upright and a negative reward if the pole falls or the cart moves out of bounds. The goal is to train an RL agent to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over episodes, thereby achieving optimal pole balancing behavior.



**Cartpole Balancing with Continuous Actions**

This repository contains an advanced implementation of **Reinforcement Learning** techniques applied to solve the Cartpole problem in the **OpenAI Gym** environment. The goal is to design and train an RL agent capable of balancing the pole on the cart using vision-based control, where the agent receives images of the environment as input.

**Key Features:**

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture:** The implementation utilizes a CNN to process visual input from the Cartpole environment, enabling the agent to learn features directly from raw pixel data.

- **Experience Replay:** To enhance training stability, an Experience Replay mechanism is employed, allowing the agent to learn from past experiences stored in a memory buffer.

- **Target Network:** A separate target network is utilized to stabilize the training process by periodically updating its weights with those of the policy network.

- **Reward Engineering:** Rewards are carefully engineered to encourage the agent to exhibit behaviors conducive to successful pole balancing, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Various hyperparameters governing the learning process are fine-tuned to optimize training efficiency and performance.

- **Real-time Plotting and Visualization:** Matplotlib is used for real-time plotting of training progress, providing insights into the agent's learning dynamics.
